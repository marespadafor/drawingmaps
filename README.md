# Drawing Maps in R
This is an introductory course on spatial data taught within the CLIC Training workshops (as part of the Advanced Topics in Social Mobility research seminar) at the European University Institute.

## Instructions

BEFORE WE START—very important:
 
### 1. Update R

Make sure you have the last R version (4.03), you can update it by downloading this version here:  https://cran.r-project.org
 
### 2. Obtain your API key from Google

THIS IS ESSENTIAL: Before we can start geocoding, we need to obtain an API key from Google. Go to the registration page, and follow the instructions (select all mapping options). The geocoding API is a free service, but up to a limit. That's why you nevertheless need to associate a card with the account (sorry about that!): https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/#get-started
 
### 3. Set your working directory

Assign a folder with all the materials and set your working directory to the folder there, use your google key and the packages that we are going to use. You can also follow lines 1-18 in "exercises_datapoints.R"
 
- You can also read about different coordinate systems, map projections and transformations: http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisengine/dotnet/89b720a5-7339-44b0-8b58-0f5bf2843393.htm
 
 
### 4. Download the materials. 

The materials for this course consist on data files, slides (in Rmarckdown), and exercises. The slides not only contain information, but also the solution to the examples and exercises for each part. Make sure you download all of them!
